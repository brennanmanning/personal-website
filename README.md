# My Website

This is my personal space on the internet. This is a simple website I built with TypeScript, [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The main addition is the ability to render Latex with [Katex](https://katex.org) provided from [Remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math). 

This was previously built with [Astro](https://astro.build)(which I greatly enjoy), but they have an issue with using Katex, so I am waiting for that to be fixed to move over to it.
