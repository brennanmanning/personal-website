# A Portfolio Website
This is the repository for my personal website. It has a little background about who I am and what my interests are. I built this with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and deployed it with [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). This is still a work in progress as I am only a novice in web development and all my experience comes from building this website. But, I have some features that will come soon to this, hopefully.

## To Do:
[] Add better mobile support
[] Add blog posts
[] Improve the style of the navbar
[] Add a link to my github
