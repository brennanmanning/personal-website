# My Personal Website

This website is inteded to be my landing page on the internet. This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) with plain HTML and CSS so far. I will need JavaScript to add in some functionality once I start writing blog posts. 

## To Do

- [ ] Add a Link to my GitHub from my Website
- [ ] Write Some Blog Posts
- [ ] Add a Light Mode Button to be able to Toggle Between Light and Dark Modes
