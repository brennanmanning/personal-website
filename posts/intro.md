# This is my first post. 

This is also the first time I'm writing something that isn't academic. So, I'm not sure how this will go. But I am willing to put myself out there to try this out.

Mainly, this will just be a place where I write about something I'm interested in and I think other people might enjoy reading about it as well. I'll probably post brief descriptions about projects I worked on or just something that I found interesting. 

This site is mainly just a hobby though. I started it to waste some time and learn some of the basics of modern web dev. I did find that I enjoyed building it a lot more than I initially expected. Right now, this site is built with Typescript, Next.js, and Tailwindcss. It isn't anything fancy, and I've mostly built it by looking at the NextJS starter and changing it to fit my needs. The only big thing I added was the ability for math expressions to be rendered nicely which is an easy change. 

My next post will probably be based on a python project that I recently finished to help me review some concepts in Option Pricing.
